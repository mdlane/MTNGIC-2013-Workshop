Developing Web-based Mobile Mapping Applications with Javascript
===========================

This repository is a collection of sample webpages, a presentation, and links to accompany the associated workshop at Mid-TNGIC 2013.

Installation
---------------------------
All webpages with a map on them and their suppporting files must be accessed from a webserver. This is a requirement of the ESRI JS api.

This [ESRI JS api page](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/javascript/jshelp/intro_devenv.html) has a good write-up on setting up your environment and tools that can be used to modify the included files.
